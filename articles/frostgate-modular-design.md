Frostgate proposes a new architecture for cross-chain interoperability—one that does **not** rely on light clients, centralized bridges, or multisig committees. Instead, it offers a **modular, verifiable system** for message passing across blockchains, primarily grounded in **cryptographic soundness** and **composable design**.

At its core, Frostgate fuses **Succinct State Validation (SSV)**, **zero-knowledge proofs**, and **chain abstraction** into a fully programmable and extensible interoperability stack. Any chain, proving system, or application can adopt it—without compromising decentralization.


## Modular by Construction

Frostgate breaks interoperability down into well-defined and composable components:

### 1. ICAP (Interoperable Chain Abstraction Protocol)

ICAP defines how `ChainAdapters` expose chain-specific logic to Frostgate. It abstracts the key components of participating chains, including:

* Finality rules (e.g., Ethereum’s FFG, BEEFY, Solana’s voting)
* Event log formats
* Message encoding and decoding
* Chain-specific light validation (without relying on state replays or full nodes)

Adapters implement a shared trait `ChainAdapter` and output a unified `FrostMessage` structure. This allows new chains to be supported independently by communities—not centralized bridge operators.


### 2. ZKPlug: Frostgate’s zk-Agnostic Backend Interface

Frostgate isn’t tied to a single proving system. The `ZKPlug` trait defines how zero-knowledge backends:

* Load and compile circuits
* Generate state proofs from messages
* Verify proofs succinctly on-chain

The current implementation integrates **SP1 zkVM**, but the design supports **pluggable backends** like **RiscZero**, **Halo2**, or **Groth16** with minimal overhead. Chains or apps can select backends based on their:

* Trust model
* Performance
* Cost

This design enables broad ecosystem flexibility.


## Message Flow: How Data Moves Trustlessly

Here’s how Frostgate handles cross-chain event propagation:

1. **Emit:** A finalized event occurs on Chain A and is processed by a `ChainAdapter`.
2. **Normalize:** The adapter converts the event into a standardized `FrostMessage`.
3. **Prove:** A prover bundles messages and generates a succinct zk-proof attesting to correctness.
4. **Relay:** A relayer submits the proof and batch to the target chain (Chain B).
5. **Verify:** A smart contract on Chain B verifies the zk-proof and processes the message.

Since zk-proofs are computationally expensive, Frostgate uses **batch proofs** to aggregate multiple messages into a single succinct proof.

All actors are **stateless**. All trust assumptions are **cryptographically based**—no chain replication, no state replays, and no multisig committees.


## Security Without Multisigs

Multisigs introduce:

* Centralization
* Failure points
* Governance complexity

Frostgate bypasses this entirely by:

* Relying on native chain finality (via adapter enforcement)
* Leveraging zk-proof soundness for message correctness
* Using proving key attestation to prevent circuit forgery
* Enabling proof-level replay protection via **batch nonces** and **timestamps**

This means Frostgate’s security scales with the **source chain’s consensus**, not with off-chain signers.


## Governance and Registry Design

Frostgate’s modularity allows anyone to implement new components to extend functionality. However, **trustless interoperability needs standards**—so Frostgate introduces a **Registry Layer**.

In our design, **anyone** can submit a new adapter or zk backend. But each submission must be **verification-gated**, meaning:

* Must pass deterministic conformance tests
* Match zk circuit constraints and output schemas
* Provide proving/verifying key hashes or attestations
* Protocol changes go through **Git-based workflows** with DAO-ready extensions for transparency

The goal: no gatekeeping, only **verifiable compliance**.


## Actor Roles in the Ecosystem

Frostgate defines **three distinct roles**:

### 1. Provers

Generate zk-proofs off-chain for message batches.  
Incentivized for correct proof generation.

### 2. Relayers

Monitor source chains and transport proofs/messages to destination chains.  
Act as trustless messengers in the Frostgate network.

### 3. Verifiers

Smart contracts on destination chains.  
Validate zk-proofs and execute source chain payloads.

All roles are **stateless** and **interchangeable**—anyone can spin up a role without permission or staking.

Incentives (e.g., sender-paid fees) are designed to cover gas costs and actor rewards—while keeping the protocol **open by design**.


## Final Thoughts

Frostgate isn’t just another interoperability bridge. It’s a **reimagining** of cross-chain messaging where **verifiability**, **modularity**, and **decentralization** are **first principles**, not afterthoughts.

By separating **consensus replication** from **interoperability** and replacing **trust** with **proof**, Frostgate offers a design that’s:

* Lean  
* Extensible  
* Ready for a multi-chain future

No light clients.  
No multisigs.  
No committees.

Just math, messages, and modularity.
