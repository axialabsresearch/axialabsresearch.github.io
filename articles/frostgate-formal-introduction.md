Frostgate can be formally described as a modular interoperability protocol that encodes cross-chain state transitions as cryptographically verifiable messages, leveraging finality assumptions and succinct proofs as its dual security anchors. In this paper, we aim to define Frostgate’s core components and mechanisms with precision, deliberately avoiding hype or extraneous narratives.

## 1. Interoperability as a Message-Passing Problem

We reduce interoperability to a problem of authenticated message-passing between asynchronous distributed state machines (chains). Each chain is treated as an isolated execution context $C$ with deterministic state transition function $\delta$.

To solve this problem, we define its core components:

* $M : \{C_i \rightarrow C_j\}$ as a verifiable message emitted from source chain $C_i$
* $\pi_M$ as a succinct cryptographic witness that attests to the inclusion and finality of the state transition that emitted $M$
* $V_j(\pi_M)$ as a verifier function on the destination chain that confirms the validity of the submitted $\pi_M$

Then,

$$
\text{Accept}_{C_j}(M) \Leftrightarrow V_j(\pi_M) = 1
$$

## 2. Finality as a Security Predicate

Frostgate treats finality as a predicate $F$, such that:

$$
F(b_i) = 1 \Leftrightarrow \text{Consensus}_{C_i}(b_i) = \text{final}
$$

For BFT-based chains, $F$ maps to a finality gadget (e.g. Casper FFG). For probabilistic finality chains (e.g. Nakamoto), $F$ includes economic confidence thresholds.

## 3. Succinct Proofs

Each $\pi_M$ is constructed using ZKIP, a SNARK-compatible circuit which captures:

* The validity of the state transition leading to $M$
* Membership in a finalized block $(b_i)$
* Commitment to the canonical source chain state $S_i$

The ZKIP-circuit is pluggable (zk-agnostic) and is defined over a common interface `ZKBackend`, allowing SNARK, STARK, or custom backends.

## 4. Interoperable Chain Abstraction via `ChainAdapter`

Each chain $C$ implements a `ChainAdapter` which is responsible for extracting chain-specific events, encoding $M$ under Frostgate’s message specs, and exposing finality primitives and proof generation hooks.

This abstraction defines an interface contract, not a binding runtime dependency, which would enable any chain community to author their own adapters.

## 5. Message Authenticity and Accountability

Frostgate avoids multisigs and committees by encoding authenticity via cryptographic verifiability opposing social consensus. To achieve this design, we define two sets of core actors forming a network of interchain oracles:

* $R$: the relayer set
* $P$: the prover set

This reduces Frostgate’s security to the following condition:

$$
\forall p \in P, \forall r \in R : V_j(\pi_M(p)) = 1 \Rightarrow \text{Relay}_r(M(p))
$$

$$
C_j \text{ accepts } M \Leftrightarrow V_j(\pi_M) = 1
$$

which holds under the honest-majority assumption only at execution, not consensus.

This formal framing allows Frostgate to be interpreted as a coprocessor to any chain, consuming cross-chain messages under strict verifiability constraints. Frostgate, however, is not a bridge; rather, we define it as a form of cross-chain state resolution via cryptographic accountability.
